Porto is a fascinating and vibrant city that has so much to offer as a holiday or city break destination. The city boasts an extensive history, unique tourist attractions, delicious cuisines and buzzing nightlife. Porto has a delightful historic center and is famed for its Port wine, but it is also a young and energetic city, with social nightlife, liberal attitudes and a flourishing artisan scene. Take a look at [this page](https://porto-north-portugal.com) for a quick guide of the city.

### Getting There...

We recommend arriving at the [**Sá Carneiro Airtport**](https://www.portoairport.pt/en/opo/home). Then, you can pick an efficient public transportation network that is at your service to get you where you need to go. Just choose the one that is more convenient for you at [this page](https://www.portoairport.pt/en/opo/access-parking/getting-to-and-from-the-airport/public-transportation). We recommend taking the Metro line E from **Botica** metro station (located near the airport) to **Casa da Música** metro station, and then either walking (aprox. 15 minutes) or taking one of the available bus lines (204, 207, 200, 209) at the **Boavista-Casa da Música** bus stations to the **Faculdade de Ciências-FCUP1** bus station. Then, you will find clear signs guiding you to the department.
