### Getting There...

The nearest airport to the city of Porto is the [**SÃ¡ Carneiro Airtport**](https://www.portoairport.pt/en/opo/home). From there, you can pick one of many efficient public transportation networks at your service on [this page](https://www.portoairport.pt/en/opo/access-parking/getting-to-and-from-the-airport/public-transportation) to get to the venue.

We recommend taking **metro line E** at the **Botica metro station** (located near the airport), and exiting at the **Trindade metro station**. From there, you can either walk to the venue (aprox. 13 min), take the **703** bus at the **Trindade bus station (TRD5)** and exit at **Guilherme Gomes Fernandes bus station**, or the **501** bus at the **Trindade bus state (TDR6)** and exit at the **Guil. G. Fernandes bus station**. From either bus stations, you will quickly meet the venue by walking south.
