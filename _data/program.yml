        title: Invited Talk&colon; On Propositional Program Equivalence
        subtitle: Tobias Kappé 
        abstract: Most programmers have an intuitive understanding of general equivalences between programs. For instance, the branches of an if-then-else block can be swapped, as long as its condition is negated --- regardless of what the branches or condition look like. Such propositional program equivalences are useful to verify that a refactoring operation preserves program semantics. Kleene Algebra with Tests (KAT) has proven to be a very powerful framework for verifying propositional program equivalences, either through manual equational reasoning or by automated equivalence checking. In recent years, the focus has been on a deterministic fragment of KAT that models imperative programs very closely, known as Guarded KAT (GKAT). GKAT has a rich equational theory, which can be used to prove many useful equivalences between imperative programs. What's more, GKAT equivalences can be checked mechanically and efficiently. We will survey recent advances surrounding GKAT. Topics discussed include both positive and negative results about GKAT's expressivity, logical completeness, extensions, and decision procedures, as well as connections to decompilation and a conjecture of Milner that was recently resolved. This talk will cover joint work with Balder ten Cate, Justin Hsu, Nate Foster, Dexter Kozen, David E. Narváez, Nico Naus, Wojciech Różowski, Todd Schmid, Alexandra Silva, Steffen Smolka, and Cheng Zhang.

        title: Axiomatization and Decidability of Tense Information Logic
        subtitle: Timo Niek Franssen and Søren Brinck Knudstorp
        abstract: Knudstorp~\cite{Knudstorp} axiomatizes modal information logic (MIL) with a supremum operator on posets. Since infima naturally complement suprema, this raises the question&colon; Can this result be extended to a modal logic that includes both operators and, if so, what axioms would govern the interaction between the two modalities? In this paper, we prove soundness and completeness of tense information logic (TIL)---a modal logic with two binary modalities, $\supp$ and $\inff$, interpreted as supremum and infimum operators over posets. Our axiomatization, which links $\supp$ and $\inff$ only through the standard tense-logic axioms, thereby resolves a question posed by van Benthem~\cite{Benthem-1}.Completeness is proven using the step-by-step method \cite{Burgess} and as a corollary, we obtain completeness of TIL on preorders. Furthermore, we prove the finite model property (FMP) of TIL with respect to a generalized class of structures, which in turn establishes decidability of the logic. By introducing both fusion ($\supp$) and refinement ($\inff$) within one logical framework, TIL provides an expressive paradigm for information dynamics.

        category: Session 1
        abstract: We discuss an infinitary refinement type system for input-output temporal specifications of functions that handle infinite objects like streams or infinite trees. Our system is based on a reformulation of Bonsangue and Kok's infinitary extension of Abramsky's Domain Theory in Logical Form to saturated properties. We show that in an interesting range of cases, our system is complete without the need of an infinitary rule introduced by Bonsangue and Kok to reflect the well-filteredness of Scott domains.

Following, we extend semantic games to develop new games and new modalities. We prove the correctness theorems in each case.

        title: Constructive Modal Logics&colon; Bi-nested Calculi and Bi-relational Countermodels
        subtitle: Han Gao and Nicola Olivetti
        category: Session 2
        abstract: The logics CK and CCDL are two fundamental systems of constructive modal logics, which aim to provide an interpretation of modalities with an intuitionistic base. Semantics of these logics can be specified in terms of bi-relational models. We define bi-nested sequent calculi for these two systems. Our calculi are cut-free and only consist of invertible rules. Moreover, they support terminating proof-search under a suitable strategy. The main feature of the calculi is that they allow to directly construct countermodels in the bi-relational semantics from any failed proof.

        category: Session 3
        abstract: This paper introduces a fuzzy approach to modal logics with graded relation updates. Specifically, we develop relation-changing modal logics where modalities modify the membership degree of a pair of elements in the accessibility relation. Our framework encompasses variants of local swap, sabotage, and bridge modalities. We motivate our approach via examples, and provide bisimulation notions for each logic, together with their corresponding characterization theorems. We also prove that model-checking for these logics is PSpace-complete, exactly as in the non-fuzzy cases.

        subtitle: Han Gao, Daniil Kozhemiachenko and Nicola Olivetti
        category: Session 3
        abstract: We present a family of paraconsistent counterparts of the constructive modal logic $\ck$. These logics aim to formalise reasoning about contradictory but non-trivial propositional attitudes like beliefs or obligations. We define their Kripke-style semantics based on intuitionistic frames with two valuations which provide independent support for truth and falsity; they are connected by strong negation as defined in Nelson's logic. A family of systems is obtained depending on whether both modal operators are defined using the same or by different accessibility relations for their positive and negative support. We propose Hilbert-style axiomatisations for all logics determined by this semantic framework. We also propose a~family of modular cut-free sequent calculi that we use to establish decidability.

        subtitle: Bjørn Kjos-Hanssen and Paul Kim Long V. Nguyen
        abstract: We analyze computable algebras (in the sense of universal algebra) in terms of index set complexity, specifically as regards their congruence lattices. We characterize simplicity of lattices as complete at the level Pi^0_2, mirroring a result of Khoussainov and Morozov (2010) for groups. Finiteness of the congruence lattice is proved complete at the level Sigma^0_3; and subdirect irreducibility at the level Sigma^0_3.

        title: Convergence laws for expansions of linear preorders
        subtitle: Vera Koponen and Edward Karlsson
        abstract: We consider a sequence $L_n, n = 1, 2, 3,...$, of linear preorders, a finite relational signature $\sigma$ including the signature $\{\preceq\}$ of the linear preorders $L_n$, and the set $W_n$ of all expansions of $L_n$ to $\sigma$. A probability distribution $P_n$ is defined on each $W_n$ (it can be e.g. the uniform distribution, but other distributions are possible). We prove that if all equivalence classes of the preorder $L_n$ grow (as $n\to\infty$) faster than every logarithm but slower than some polynomial, then every first-order formula is almost surely equivalent to a (in general) simpler formula that only expresses distances between variables and which atomic formulas they satisfy. As a corollary we get a convergence law for formulas, and zero-one law for sentences, of first-order logic. If we also assume that for some positive integer $\lambda$ the number of equivalence classes  of every $L_n$ is exactly $\lambda$ and that all equivalence classes have roughly the same size, then we can also almost surely eliminate ``proportion quantifiers'' that express, for some $0 < r < 1$, that the proportion of elements satisfying a formula is larger than $r$; and we get a convergence law for first-order logic extended by such quantifiers.

        title: Deep Induction for Inductive Families
        subtitle: Patricia Johann and Edward Morehouse
        category: Session 2
        abstract: Deep induction provides induction rules for deep data types, i.e., data types that are defined over, or mutually recursively with, (other) such data types. Deep induction is currently defined only for type-indexed types, such as ADTs, nested types, and GADTs. In this paper we show how to extend deep induction from data types with only type indices to data types with term indices as well. Specifically, we extend to inductive families — as found in dependently typed systems such as Agda, Epigram, and Idris — the methodology for deriving sound deep induction rules that was originally developed for nested types and has recently been extended to GADTs.

Some properties of sentential predicates are studied and an analogy with nominal quantifiers is pointed out. An application to the analysis of questions i (interrogative sentences) is made.  Questions are  rogative sentential predicates (which are semantically defined). No reference to possible worlds is made in the proposed analysis.

        title: On tame semantics for interpretability logic
        subtitle: Vicent Navarro Arroyo and Joost Johannes Joosten
        abstract: We study modal logics of interpretability. These logics are propositional modal logics with a binary modality ▷ and a unary modality □ that model formalised versions of relativized interpretability and provability respectively. The standard relational semantics for interpretability logics goes by the name of Veltman semantics. Veltman models have a unary accessibility relation R to model the unary □ modality and a ternary accessibility relation S to model the binary modality ▷. Models can possess wild behaviour and in a sense cannot be tree-like. In this paper we study if we can tame the complexity of the needed models by resorting to a slightly tweaked notion of semantics. We prove soundness and completeness for this new semantics which follows from the right notion of bisimulation. The motivation for this study is rooted in a long-standing open question to determine IL(All), the interpretability logic of all reasonable arithmetical theories. In this paper we strengthen a conjecture formulated in [5] and show that the new conjecture is consistent with the literature so far.

        subtitle: Elena Romanenko, Oliver Kutz, Diego Calvanese and Giancarlo Guizzardi
        category: Session 3
        abstract: Utilizing abstractions of large conceptual models may enhance understanding and comprehension of these models. Although the existing algorithm for providing abstractions for ontology-driven conceptual models was empirically evaluated over the FAIR catalog of such models, it still lacks formal semantics. This paper aims to address this gap by formalizing basic transformations underlying the abstraction process in SROIQ, the expressive and decidable description logic underlying OWL 2 DL. Specifically, it is shown that these transformations with some assumptions are obtained by a formal procedure known as axiom weakening.

        title: Counterexamples to Import-Export in Conditionals&colon; A Logical Analysis
        subtitle: Eric Raidl and Gilberto Gomes
        abstract: It is usually considered that A ↣ (B ↣ C) (i) implies and (ii) is implied by (A∧B) ↣ C. (i) is called Import (IM) and (ii) Export (EX). IM seems to be valid for natural language conditionals, but here we present counterexamples to EX, such as&colon; If he uses cocaine every weekend and hides it from his family, he is already addicted, but not&colon; If he uses cocaine every weekend, then if he hides it from his family, he is already addicted. Gibbard’s collapse theorem depends on IM-EX and Simplification (Conjunction Elimination). Here we use the implicative conditional for a logical analysis of IM-EX. We show that Possibilistic versions of IM and EX are respectively valid and invalid for the implicative conditional, in accordance with what is observed in natural language conditionals. We conclude that this supports the adequacy of the implicative conditional for analysing the implicative use of natural language conditionals. We also conclude that the implicative conditional is immune to Gibbard’s collapse theorem, since it invalidates both IM-EX and Simplification.

        title: Logics of Importation and Exportation for the Implicative Conditional
        subtitle: Eric Raidl
        category: Session 4
        abstract: The implicative conditional, A => C strengthens the strict conditional by the possibility of the antecedent A and the possibility of the negated consequent C, and circumvents the paradoxes of the latter, all by remaining modally interpretable. This paper extends the analysis from  Raidl and Gomes (submission 12) where Import (IM) and Export (EX) are analyzed for =>, as well as possibilistic versions, where either the possibilitiy of the antecedent of the consequent conditional (P1X) or the consequent of it (P2X) or both (PPX) are added as antecedent of the principle (X= IM or EX). In reflexive Kripke models, => only validates PPIM. The implicative conditional validates the weakest possibilistic version (PPIM)  of Importation, all Exportations are invalid (in reflexive Kripke models). Here I investigate the other principles and their modal counterparts. I show that, in reflexive Kripke models, P1IM corresponds to the modal axiom 4, and IM to  4 together with the provability axiom Grz. Hence, there is an implicative interpretation of C.I. Lewis' logic S4 as well as of the provability logic Grz. On the other hand, in Kripke models, P2EX (and hence PPEX) corresponds to the modal axiom 5 together with shift discreteness. It is then easily  shown that all Exportations imply the collapse of possibility to necessity (discreteness). Hence, although there are non-trivial ways to validate Importation(s), there is no non-trivial way for => to validate Exportation from a normal modal logic perspective.

        title: Indicative conditionals&colon; algebraic considerations
        subtitle: Umberto Rivieccio and Miguel Muñoz Pérez
        abstract: We consider a family of non-classical three-valued logics that have been proposed to model 'indicative conditionals' – sentences of the 'if-then' type that occur in natural language, and concern what could be true (as opposed to counterfactuals, which concern eventualities that are no longer possible). Among these, we study the systems introduced by B. De Finetti, W.S. Cooper, J. Cantwell and R.J. Farrell, as well as some natural variants that have not yet appeared in the literature. We determine which of these logics are 'algebraizable' (in the sense of Blok and Pigozzi), providing equational presentations for the corresponding algebraic counterparts from which finite Hilbert-style calculi can be readily obtained. Even in the nonalgebraizable cases we indicate how algebraic techniques may be employed to obtain further semantical insight into the logics and axiomatizations. In the concluding section we point to possible extensions of the present work, e.g. further analysis of the relevant classes of algebras via 'twist-structure' representations.

        title: Invited Talk&colon; Functorial Mealy machines
        subtitle: Daniela Petrişan
        category: Invited Talk
        abstract: We first recall a functorial framework for automata theory bridging the algebraic and coalgebraic approach. Various forms of automata can be seen as functors from an input category -- describing the structure of the input, e.g. words or trees -- to an output category -- describing the values produced by a run in such an automaton. For example, deterministic, nondeterministic, weighted automata or transducers over some input alphabet A can all be seen as automata with effects, or functors from the same input category (parametric on A) to some Kleisli category -- modelling the corresponding side-effect&colon; the Kleisli category of the powerset monad for nondeterministic automata, vector spaces for weighted automata over a field, etc. The framework allows for generic minimization and learning algorithms and can be extended from automata over words to tree automata, by suitably modifying the input category. In the rest of the talk we focus on how to model, minimize and learn Mealy machines in this setting. We also discuss the relation with recent work on effectful Mealy machines by Bonchi et al.

        title: Proof Search in Classical Propositional Logic with Partial Proof Terms
        subtitle: José Espírito Santo and Ana Catarina Sousa
        abstract: Partial (i.e. unfinished) proofs can be represented by partial proof terms. These are proof terms expressing gaps in incomplete derivations with the help of formal sequents, that is, sequents occurring as proper components of the syntax of proof terms. Our previous paper applied this methodology to intuitionistic propositional logic, to show that focusing in sequent calculus corresponds to intercalation in bidirectional natural deduction. The main goal of this paper is to extend these results to classical logic, using the same methodology. We consider the focused sequent calculus LKT and a bidirectional natural deduction system with alternative conclusions, NKT, where the admissible typing rule for structural substitution is in fact an elimination rule for alternative implications.

        subtitle: Avgerinos Delkos and Marianna Girlando
        abstract: When evaluating a counterfactual statement, it is often convenient to specify conditions that ought to be kept unchanged. Formally, this can be done by associating to each counterfactual a ceteris paribus set of formulas, specifying the facts that “ought to be kept unchanged”. Ceteris paribus counterfactuals originate in the debate between D. Lewis and Fine in the 1970s, and have been captured in formal accounts. However, these accounts are merely based on ‘counting’ formulas, and can yield counterintuitive results. In this paper, we develop a novel approach to evaluate ceteris paribus counterfactuals at (weakly) centered spher models, by taking into account the ‘significance’ of formulas that ought to be kept unchanged. Hypothetical states that keep the most significant formulas unchanged will be prioritized in the evaluation of a counterfactual. We show that the resulting notion of validity coincides with theoremhood in Lewis’ conditional logics VC or VW.

        title: Tabular intermediate logics comparison
        subtitle: Paweł Rzążewski and Michał Stronkowski
        category: Session 1
        abstract: Tabular intermediate logics are intermediate logics characterized by finite posets treated as Kripke frames. For a poset $\mathbb P$, let $L(\mathbb P)$ denote the corresponding tabular intermediate logic. We investigate the complexity of the following decision problem {\sf LogContain}&colon; given two finite posets $\mathbb P$ and $\mathbb Q$, decide whether $L(\mathbb P) \subseteq L(\mathbb Q)$. By Jankov's and de Jongh's theorem, the problem {\sf LogContain} is related to the problem {\sf SPMorph}&colon; given two finite posets $\mathbb P$ and $\mathbb Q$, decide whether there exists a surjective $p$-morphism from $\mathbb P$ onto $\mathbb Q$.  Both problems belong to the complexity class NP.We present two contributions. First, we describe a construction which, starting with a graph $\mathbb G$, gives a poset ${\sf Pos}(\mathbb G)$ such that there is a surjective locally surjective homomorphism (the graph-theoretic analog of a $p$-morphism) from $\mathbb G$ onto $\mathbb H$ if and only if there is a surjective $p$-morphism from ${\sf Pos}(\mathbb G)$ onto ${\sf Pos}(\mathbb H)$. This allows us to translate some hardness results from graph theory and obtain that several restricted versions of the problems {\sf LogContain} and {\sf SPMorph} are NP-complete. Among other results, we present a 18-element poset $\Q$ such that the problem to decide, for a given poset $\P$, whether $L(\P)\subseteq L(\Q)$ is NP-complete. Second, we  describe a polynomial-time algorithm that decides {\sf LogContain} and {\sf SPMorph} for posets $\mathbb T$ and $\mathbb Q$, when $\mathbb T$ is a tree.

        abstract: The separation logic of relations (SLR) is a generalization of separation logic (SL) which is useful to describe complex structures like graphs and relational databases. SLR extends SL by interpreting heaps as (multi)sets of relational atoms instead of partial functions. This paper addresses the satisfiability problem for SLR formulas with additional shape constraints (called patterns) expressing conditions such as uniqueness of atoms or functionality of relations. We show that the satisfiability problem is 2-EXPTIME-complete when (dis)equalities over existential variables are excluded from the considered patterns, and undecidable otherwise.

        subtitle: Klaus-Dieter Schewe

        abstract: In this article choiceless polynomial time (CPT) is extended using non-deterministic Abstract State Machines (ASMs), which are restricted by three conditions&colon; (1) choice is restricted to choice among atoms; (2) update sets in a state must be isomorphic; (3) for any two isomorphic update sets on states S and S', respectively, the sets of update sets of the corresponding successor states are isomorphic. The restrictions can be incorporated into the semantics of ASM rules such that update sets are only yielded, if the conditions are satisfied. Furthermore, the conditions can be checked in polynomial time on a simulating Turing machine. Finally, the conditions imply global insignificance, i.e. the final result is independent from the choices. These properties suffice to show that the ASMs restricted this way define a logic capturing PTIME, which we call insignificant choice polynomial time (ICPT).
