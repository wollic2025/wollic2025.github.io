WoLLIC is an annual international forum on interdisciplinary research involving formal logic, computing and programming theory, and natural language and reasoning. Each meeting includes invited talks and tutorials as well as contributed papers. The thirty-first WoLLIC will be held at the University of Porto, Portugal, 14-17 July 2025. 

# SCOPE

Contributions are invited on all pertinent subjects, with particular interest in cross-disciplinary topics. Typical but not exclusive areas of interest are: 
- non-classical logics; 
- foundations of computing, programming and Artificial Intelligence (AI);
- novel computation models and paradigms; 
- broad notions of proof and belief; 
- proof mining, type theory, effective learnability and explainable AI; 
- formal methods in software and hardware development; 
- logical approach to natural language and reasoning; 
- logics of programs, actions and resources; 
- foundational aspects of information organization, search, flow, sharing and protection; 
- foundations of mathematics; 
- philosophical logic; 
- and philosophy of language.

# PROCEEDINGS

The proceedings of WoLLIC 2025, including both invited and contributed papers, will be published in advance of the meeting as a volume in Springer's LNCS series. In addition, abstracts will be published in the Conference Report section of the Logic Journal of the IGPL, and selected contributions will be published (after a new round of reviewing) as special post-conference WoLLIC 2025 issue of a scientific journal (TBA).

# SUBMISSIONS

Proposed contributions should be in English, and consist of a scholarly exposition accessible to the non-specialist, including motivation, background, and comparison with related works. Articles should be written in the LaTeX format of LNCS by Springer (see author's instructions [here](http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0)). They must not exceed 12 pages, with up to 5 additional pages for references and technical appendices. The paper's main results must not be published or submitted for publication in refereed venues, including journals and other scientific meetings. It is expected that each accepted paper be presented at the meeting by one of its authors in person. (At least one author is required to pay a full, on-site registration fee before granting that the paper will be published in the proceedings.) Papers must be submitted electronically at the [WoLLIC 2025's EasyChair website](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wollic2025).
