    <label for="abstract-two" class="link-like">&#9660;&nbsp;<em>Show Abstract</em></label>
    <div class="read-more">
    <p>Most programmers have an intuitive understanding of general equivalences
    between programs. For instance, the branches of an if-then-else block can be
    swapped, as long as its condition is negated --- regardless of what the
    branches or condition look like. Such propositional program equivalences are
    useful to verify that a refactoring operation preserves program semantics.</p>

    <p>Kleene Algebra with Tests (KAT) has proven to be a very powerful framework for
    verifying propositional program equivalences, either through manual equational
    reasoning or by automated equivalence checking. In recent years, the focus has
    been on a deterministic fragment of KAT that models imperative programs very
    closely, known as Guarded KAT (GKAT). GKAT has a rich equational theory, which
    can be used to prove many useful equivalences between imperative programs.
    What's more, GKAT equivalences can be checked mechanically and efficiently.</p>

    <p>We will survey recent advances surrounding GKAT. Topics discussed include both
    positive and negative results about GKAT's expressivity, logical completeness,
    extensions, and decision procedures, as well as connections to decompilation
    and a conjecture of Milner that was recently resolved.</p>

    <p>This talk will cover joint work with Balder ten Cate, Justin Hsu, Nate Foster,
    Dexter Kozen, David E. Narváez, Nico Naus, Wojciech Różowski, Todd Schmid,
    Alexandra Silva, Steffen Smolka, and Cheng Zhang.</p>

    <label for="abstract-one" class="link-like">&#9660;&nbsp;<em>Show Abstract</em></label>
    <div class="read-more">
        <p>We first recall a functorial framework for automata theory bridging the algebraic 
        and coalgebraic approach. Various forms of automata can be seen as functors from an 
        input category -- describing the structure of the input, e.g. words or trees -- to an 
        output category -- describing the values produced by a run in such an automaton. For example, 
        deterministic, nondeterministic, weighted automata or transducers over some input alphabet 
        A can all be seen as automata with effects, or functors from the same input category 
        (parametric on A) to some Kleisli category -- modelling the corresponding side-effect: the 
        Kleisli category of the powerset monad for nondeterministic automata, vector spaces for weighted
         automata over a field, etc. The framework allows for generic minimization and learning algorithms
          and can be extended from automata over words to tree automata, by suitably modifying the input
          category. In the rest of the talk we focus on how to model, minimize and learn Mealy machines in 
          this setting. We also discuss the relation with recent work on effectful Mealy machines by Bonchi 
          et al.</p>

## FORMAT

WoLLIC 2025 will be an **onsite** event.

## ORGANIZATION

- [Department of Computer Science](https://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/site/), [Faculty of Sciences](https://www.up.pt/fcup/en/), [University of Porto](https://www.up.pt/portal/en/), [Portugal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal)
- [Center of Informatics](https://portal.cin.ufpe.br/), [Federal University of Pernambuco](https://www.ufpe.br/), [Brazil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil)

## SCOPE

Contributions are invited on all pertinent subjects, with particular interest in cross-disciplinary topics. Typical but not exclusive areas of interest are: 

- non-classical logics;
- foundations of computing, programming and Artificial Intelligence (AI);
- novel computation models and paradigms;
- broad notions of proof and belief;
- proof mining, type theory, effective learnability and explainable AI; 
- formal methods in software and hardware development;
- logical approach to natural language and reasoning;
- logics of programs, actions and resources;
- foundational aspects of information organization, search, flow, sharing and protection; 
- foundations of mathematics;
- philosophical logic;
- and philosophy of language.

## PROCEEDINGS

The proceedings of WoLLIC 2025, including both invited and contributed papers, will be published in advance of the meeting as a volume in **Springer's LNCS series**. In addition, abstracts will be published in the Conference Report section of the **Logic Journal of the IGPL**, and selected contributions will be published (after a new round of reviewing) as special post-conference WoLLIC 2025 issue of a **scientific journal** (TBC).

## SUBMISSIONS

Proposed contributions should be in English, and consist of a scholarly exposition accessible to the non-specialist, including motivation, background, and comparison with related works. Articles should be written in the LaTeX format of **LNCS by Springer** (see author's instructions [here](http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0)). They must not exceed **12 pages**, with up to **5 additional pages** for **references and technical appendices**. The paper's main results must not be published or submitted for publication in refereed venues, including journals and other scientific meetings. It is expected that each accepted paper be presented at the meeting by one of its authors in person. (At least one author is required to pay a full, on-site registration fee before granting that the paper will be published in the proceedings.) Papers must be submitted electronically at the [WoLLIC 2025 EasyChair website](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wollic2025).
